######################################################################
# Possible structure - Work in progress

## **Introduction**

-   Definition and scope of imagery data

-   Comparison to traditional modes of data collection

-   Importance of satellite imagery within broader geospatial and imagery data

-   Historical context and evolution of satellite imagery

-   Objectives and structure of the chapter

## **Fundamentals of Satellite Imagery**

-   Types of satellite imagery

    -   Optical (e.g. multispectral, panchromatic)

    -   Radar (e.g. SAR)

    -   Thermal and hyperspectral imaging

-   Key satellite platforms and missions

    -   Governmental (e.g. Landsat, Sentinel)

    -   Commercial (e.g. Maxar, Planet)

-   Resolution

    -   Spatial, temporal, spectral, and radiometric

## **Data Acquisition and Accessibility**

-   Sources of satellite imagery (open-access vs. commercial)

-   Access platforms and APIs (e.g. Google Earth Engine, Copernicus Open Access Hub)

-   Licensing, cost, and ethical considerations

-   Cloud-based repositories and big data challenges

## **Pre-processing and Calibration**

-   Georeferencing and orthorectification

-   Radiometric and atmospheric corrections

-   Cloud masking and data fusion

-   Handling noise and inconsistencies

## **Analytical Methods and Tools**

-   Image classification (supervised, unsupervised, deep learning approaches)

-   Change detection techniques

-   Object-based image analysis (OBIA)

-   Time-series analysis and spatio-temporal modelling

-   Software and programming libraries (e.g. QGIS, ENVI, SNAP, Python)

## **Emerging Trends and Why Imagery Matters Now**

-   High-frequency and high-resolution satellites

-   AI and machine learning integration

-   Integration with other data sources (e.g. Census, social media)

-   Real-time and near-real-time monitoring systems

-   Policy and governance implications in satellite data use


#LATER CHAPTER ######################
## **Challenges and Considerations** \[Might be more suitable for a later chapter towards the end\]

-   Data volume and processing power needs

-   Technical limitations (e.g. cloud cover, revisit times)

-   Interpretation biases and accuracy concerns

-   Equity in data access and usage rights
